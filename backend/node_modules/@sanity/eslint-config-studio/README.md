|              | `eslint-config-sanity`                             | `@sanity/eslint-config-studio`                                                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use case     | internal projects                                  | offered publicly to be used in the [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio) |
| Rule set     | opinionated, enforces internal conventions         | unobtrusive, unopinionated, offered solely to catch bugs                         |
| Dependencies | contains many presets but must install each plugin | contains only one preset, but install plugins for you\*                          |

\*Note: This package utilizes [`@rushstack/eslint-patch`](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/tree/ebee58403b1595027da7ef00a4d817d83ecbd737/eslint/eslint-patch#what-it-does) to include plugins as dependencies. This making installation easier and allows us to manage those dependencies for you.

Since this package includes dependencies to plugins, it will never have more than one preset.
